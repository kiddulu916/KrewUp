# KrewUp Terms of Service

Effective Date: 12/28/25

## 1. Acceptance of the Agreement

By creating an account on KrewUp, you agree to these Terms of Service. You acknowledge that KrewUp is a technology platform that facilitates connections between construction industry professionals and is not an employment agency, staffing service, or labour provider. By completing the account creation process, you confirm that you understand: (i) KrewUp acts solely as a passive online venue and does not employ, recruit, screen, or place workers; (ii) KrewUp does not recommend, endorse, or guarantee any user; (iii) you are solely responsible for evaluating any user you choose to work with; and (iv) any work arrangement you enter into with another user is at your own risk. If you are using KrewUp on behalf of a company, you represent that you have the authority to bind that entity to these terms.

### Account Eligibility and Registration

To use KrewUp, you must meet the following eligibility requirements:

Age Requirement: You must be at least eighteen (18) years of age to create an account and use the platform. By registering, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old. KrewUp does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 18. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a user under 18, we will delete that information promptly. If you believe a user under 18 has provided us with personal information, please contact us at [Insert Email Address].

Legal Capacity: You must have the legal capacity to enter into a binding contract in your jurisdiction.

Accurate Information: You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration and to update such information to keep it accurate, current, and complete.

Account Security: You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify KrewUp immediately of any unauthorised use of your account.

One Account Per Person: Each user may maintain only one account. Creating multiple accounts may result in termination of all accounts.

## 2. The Scope of KrewUp Services

KrewUp is an online technology platform that operates solely as a passive digital venue, enabling construction industry professionals—including contractors, tradespeople, developers, and property owners—to create profiles, discover one another, and establish direct contact for potential work opportunities. KrewUp does not participate in, facilitate, or have any involvement in the negotiation, formation, or performance of any work arrangements between users.

No Employment Agency Status: KrewUp is not an employer, employment agency, headhunter, staffing agency, labour hire company, or recruitment service, and nothing in these Terms or on the platform shall be construed as creating an employment relationship between KrewUp and any user. KrewUp's services are strictly limited to: (i) hosting user profiles; (ii) providing search and discovery tools; (iii) enabling users to send and receive messages; and (iv) displaying user-submitted credential verification status. KrewUp does not recruit, interview, screen, place, employ, supervise, or manage workers on behalf of any user. KrewUp exercises no control over the terms, conditions, quality, legality, or safety of any work performed. Any work arrangement entered into between users is made directly between those parties, and KrewUp is not a party to, and assumes no responsibility for, any such arrangement.

User Acknowledgment of Platform's Limited Role: By using KrewUp, you acknowledge and agree that: (i) KrewUp is solely a technology platform for users to create profiles, discover one another, and establish direct contact—KrewUp does not participate in, facilitate, or have any involvement in any work arrangements between users; (ii) KrewUp does not employ, recruit, screen, recommend, endorse, or vouch for any user; (iii) KrewUp assumes no responsibility for the quality, legality, safety, or suitability of any work performed, the accuracy of any user's representations, or the ability of any user to fulfil obligations; (iv) you are solely responsible for conducting your own due diligence, including verifying credentials, qualifications, insurance, and references; (v) any agreement you enter into with another user is made directly between you and that user, at your own risk; and (vi) KrewUp is not a party to any such agreement and shall bear no responsibility for disputes arising therefrom.

No Guarantees: KrewUp provides a digital venue for users to connect but makes no guarantees, representations, or warranties regarding outcomes. Specifically, KrewUp does not guarantee: (i) that any worker will find employment or work opportunities; (ii) that any developer, contractor, or property owner will find qualified, available, or suitable workers; (iii) the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any user profile or information; (iv) the quality, safety, or legality of any work performed; or (v) the successful completion of any project or transaction between users.

### Example-1

A residential developer may post a need for 10 framers, but KrewUp does not guarantee those positions will be filled or that the applicants will meet the developer's specific quality standards.

## 3. Non-Negotiable Certification and License Verification

To maintain the integrity of the KrewUp community, professional users must provide proof of valid trade licenses and certifications.

Verification Requirement: Providing this information is a non-negotiable condition of maintaining a "Pro" or "Contractor" account status. You acknowledge that KrewUp acts solely as a passive venue for displaying user-submitted credential information and does not independently verify, authenticate, or guarantee the validity, accuracy, currency, or scope of any licenses, certifications, or credentials you provide. You are solely responsible for ensuring that all credential information you submit is accurate, current, and complete.

Credential Upload Acknowledgment: By uploading any license, certification, or professional credential to the platform, you acknowledge and agree that: (i) you are solely responsible for the accuracy and currency of all credential information you provide; (ii) KrewUp acts only as a passive venue for displaying user-submitted credential information and does not verify or guarantee any credentials; (iii) KrewUp does not monitor for license expirations or revocations—you are responsible for updating credentials that are no longer valid; (iv) any "verified" status displayed indicates only that you have submitted documentation and does not constitute an endorsement by KrewUp; (v) you will indemnify KrewUp from any claims arising from your credential information; and (vi) KrewUp reserves the right to remove credentials or suspend your account if information provided is inaccurate or fraudulent.

Third-Party Incident Disclaimer: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, KrewUp shall not be liable for any incidents, disputes, claims, or damages arising from or related to the status, validity, or accuracy of any user's license, certification, insurance, or professional credentials. Users acknowledge that: (i) KrewUp does not independently verify the authenticity or validity of licenses and certifications; (ii) KrewUp does not monitor for license expirations or revocations; (iii) any verification features are provided for convenience only and do not constitute a guarantee of any user; and (iv) users are solely responsible for conducting their own due diligence before entering into any work arrangement.

### Example-2

If a contractor's license expires mid-project after they were introduced via KrewUp, if their license is subsequently revoked, if they perform work for which they are not actually licensed, or if a hiring party relies on credential information displayed on the platform without conducting independent verification, KrewUp holds no liability for the resulting building code violations, insurance claims, or any other damages or losses.

## 4. Limitation of Liability for On-Site Conduct

KrewUp provides a digital handshake; we do not oversee the job site.

User-Induced Incidents: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, KrewUp, its officers, directors, employees, agents, and affiliates shall not be liable for any physical injury, death, property damage, financial loss, business interruption, loss of profits, data loss, or any other direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from or in connection with any user hired, contracted, or introduced through the platform, regardless of whether such damages were foreseeable or whether KrewUp was advised of the possibility of such damages.

Hiring Responsibility: The decision to enter into a work agreement, and all subsequent interactions, negotiations, contracts, and on-site activities, are solely between the users. Users acknowledge and agree that KrewUp acts only as a passive venue for connecting parties and exercises no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the quality, safety, legality, or suitability of work performed, the truth or accuracy of user representations, or the ability of users to complete transactions or fulfil obligations.

### Example-3

If a homeowner hires a plumber via KrewUp and the plumber accidentally causes a flood, the homeowner agrees that KrewUp is not responsible for the damages, cost of repairs, any resulting personal injury, or any claims brought by third parties. This limitation applies regardless of the legal theory under which such liability is asserted, including but not limited to negligence, breach of contract, strict liability, or any other theory.<

Indemnification: You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold KrewUp, its officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, and affiliates from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or relating to: (i) your use of the platform; (ii) your violation of these Terms; (iii) your violation of any rights of another party; (iv) any work performed or services provided by you or on your behalf; or (v) any dispute between you and another user.

Assumption of Risk: Users expressly assume all risks associated with connecting with, hiring, or being hired by other users through KrewUp, including risks related to on-site safety, worker qualifications, project outcomes, and financial transactions. Users acknowledge that the construction industry involves inherent risks and agree that KrewUp shall bear no liability for any such risks.

Cap on Liability: In any event where liability cannot be fully disclaimed under applicable law, KrewUp's total aggregate liability to any user shall not exceed the greater of (a) the amount paid by such user to KrewUp in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim, or (b) one hundred US dollars ($100).

Jurisdiction-Specific Limitations: Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain warranties, liabilities, or damages. If you reside in such a jurisdiction, some or all of the above exclusions or limitations may not apply to you, and you may have additional rights. In such cases, KrewUp's liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. Nothing in these Terms shall exclude or limit liability for: (i) death or personal injury caused by KrewUp's gross negligence or wilful misconduct; (ii) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation by KrewUp; or (iii) any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.

European Union Users: If you are a consumer residing in the European Union, you are entitled to any mandatory provisions of consumer protection legislation in your country of residence. Nothing in these Terms affects your statutory rights as a consumer that cannot be waived or limited by contract. Any disputes shall be subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of your place of residence.

California Users: If you are a California resident, you expressly waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states: "A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party." You also have specific rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) as detailed in our Privacy Policy.

Canadian Users: If you reside in Canada, you are entitled to the protections afforded by the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) and any applicable provincial privacy legislation. Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits any rights you may have under applicable Canadian consumer protection legislation that cannot be waived or excluded by contract. If you reside in the Province of Quebec, you acknowledge that this agreement and all related documents have been drafted in English at your request. Si vous résidez dans la province de Québec, vous reconnaissez que ce contrat et tous les documents connexes ont été rédigés en anglais à votre demande.

Governing Law: Except as otherwise required by applicable law, these Terms and any disputes arising out of or related to these Terms or the platform shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, United States, without regard to its conflict of law principles. You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Delaware for the resolution of any disputes, except where prohibited by law or where mandatory consumer protection laws grant you the right to bring proceedings in your local courts.

## 5. Background Checks and Drug Testing

IMPORTANT NOTICE: KrewUp does not perform, and has never performed, any criminal background checks, criminal history screenings, sex offender registry checks, drug or alcohol testing, identity verification beyond basic account authentication, or any other screening of users' personal history, character, or fitness for employment. KrewUp makes no representations whatsoever regarding the criminal history, character, integrity, reliability, or trustworthiness of any user. You expressly acknowledge and agree that you have read and understood this disclaimer before using the platform.

Hiring Party Responsibility: By using KrewUp to find or hire workers, you acknowledge that KrewUp does not screen users for criminal history, and that users on the platform may have criminal records. It is the sole responsibility of the hiring party to conduct necessary due diligence before allowing any worker access to a job site, home, or other premises, including: (i) criminal background checks at federal, state/provincial, and local levels; (ii) sex offender registry searches; (iii) reference and employment history verification; (iv) drug and alcohol testing; (v) verification of immigration status and work authorisation; (vi) assessment of professional qualifications and licensing; and (vii) any other screening required by applicable law or prudent hiring practices. Users acknowledge that KrewUp has no obligation to perform any such checks and makes no representations regarding the suitability, character, qualifications, criminal history, or legal status of any user.

Mandatory Acknowledgment Checkbox: Before accessing or using KrewUp's services to find or hire workers, you must affirmatively check a box confirming that: (i) you have read and understood the foregoing disclaimers regarding KrewUp's non-performance of background checks; (ii) you understand that users on the platform may have criminal records, including records involving violent crimes, property crimes, theft, fraud, or other offences; (iii) you accept sole and exclusive responsibility for conducting any and all background checks, screenings, and due diligence you deem necessary or appropriate before allowing any worker access to your premises or engaging them for work; (iv) you voluntarily assume all risks associated with hiring or working with any user found through the platform; and (v) you release KrewUp from any and all liability arising from the conduct, criminal history, or background of any user. This acknowledgment is a condition precedent to your use of the platform, and your continued use of the platform constitutes ongoing affirmation of this acknowledgment. KrewUp reserves the right to require re-acknowledgment at any time and may suspend or terminate your account if you fail to complete the required acknowledgment.

No Liability for User Conduct: **TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, KREWUP SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIMS, DAMAGES, LOSSES, INJURIES, OR EXPENSES ARISING FROM THE CONDUCT, ACTIONS, OR BACKGROUND OF ANY USER,** including but not limited to: theft, assault, harassment, fraud, property damage, personal injury, drug or alcohol impairment, violation of any law, or misrepresentation of qualifications or identity. This limitation applies regardless of the legal theory under which liability is asserted and whether such damages were foreseeable. Users agree to release, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless KrewUp from any such claims.

### Example

A commercial developer requiring a "drug-free workplace" must arrange for their own testing of any worker found through KrewUp before that worker enters the job site.

## 6. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration

Please read this section carefully as it affects your legal rights, including your right to file a lawsuit in court.

Agreement to Arbitrate: You and KrewUp agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms, your use of the platform, or any services provided through KrewUp (collectively, "Disputes") shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that either party may bring individual claims in small claims court if the claims qualify.

Arbitration Rules and Procedures: The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with its Consumer Arbitration Rules then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any in-person arbitration hearing shall take place in Wilmington, Delaware, unless the parties agree otherwise or the arbitrator determines that another location is more appropriate.

Arbitration Fees: Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees shall be governed by the AAA Rules. If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration would be prohibitive compared to the costs of litigation, KrewUp will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.

Opt-Out Right: You may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending written notice to KrewUp at [Insert Address] within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms. Your notice must include your name, address, email address, and a clear statement that you wish to opt out of this arbitration provision. If you opt out, neither party will be bound by this arbitration agreement, but all other provisions of these Terms will remain in effect.

Survival: This arbitration agreement shall survive termination of your account and these Terms.

## 7. Class Action Waiver

Waiver of Class and Collective Actions: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and KrewUp each agree that any Dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. You expressly waive any right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any class action, collective action, private attorney general action, or other representative proceeding against KrewUp.

No Consolidation: The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of class or representative proceeding. If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief, then that claim or request for relief shall be severed and proceeded in a court of competent jurisdiction, while the remaining claims shall be arbitrated.

Limitation on Relief: The arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favour of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. Any relief awarded cannot affect other users.

## 8. Intellectual Property Rights

KrewUp Ownership: The KrewUp platform, including its website, mobile applications, logos, trademarks, service marks, trade names, software, code, algorithms, user interface designs, and all other intellectual property (collectively, "KrewUp IP"), are the exclusive property of KrewUp and its licensors. Nothing in these Terms grants you any right, title, or interest in any KrewUp IP, except for the limited licence to use the platform as expressly set forth herein.

You represent and warrant that you own or have the necessary rights to grant this licence and that your User Content does not infringe any third-party rights.

User Content Responsibility: You retain ownership of your User Content, but you are solely responsible for ensuring that it does not violate any applicable laws, infringe upon any intellectual property rights, or contain any defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable material. KrewUp reserves the right to remove any User Content that violates these Terms or is otherwise objectionable, in its sole discretion.

DMCA and Copyright Complaints: If you believe that any content on the platform infringes your copyright, please submit a notice to KrewUp's designated copyright agent at [Insert Email Address] containing: (i) a description of the copyrighted work; (ii) identification of the allegedly infringing material and its location on the platform; (iii) your contact information; (iv) a statement that you have a good faith belief that the use is not authorised; (v) a statement under penalty of perjury that the information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorised to act on behalf of the owner; and (vi) your electronic or physical signature.

## 11. Termination

Termination by You: You may terminate your account at any time by following the account deletion process in your account settings or by contacting KrewUp at [Insert Email Address].

Suspension: KrewUp may, as an alternative to termination, suspend your account temporarily while investigating potential violations of these Terms. During any suspension period, you will not be able to access your account or the platform. KrewUp will endeavour to notify you of the reason for suspension and provide an opportunity to respond, but is not obligated to do so where it believes immediate action is necessary to protect the platform or other users.

Your appeal should include your account information and a detailed explanation of why you believe the action was unwarranted. KrewUp will review your appeal and respond within thirty (30) days. KrewUp's decision on any appeal shall be final and binding.

## 14. Severability

Severability of Provisions: If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect. The invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid, legal, and enforceable while preserving the parties' original intent as closely as possible. If such modification is not possible, the provision shall be severed from these Terms.

Preservation of Intent: In the event any provision is severed or modified pursuant to this Section, the remaining provisions of these Terms shall be interpreted and enforced in a manner that most closely effectuates the original intent of the parties and the overall purpose of these Terms.

No Waiver by Severance: The severance or modification of any provision shall not be construed as a waiver of KrewUp's right to enforce the remaining provisions of these Terms or to seek enforcement of similar provisions in other contexts.

## 15. Entire Agreement and Amendments

Entire Agreement: These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy, any applicable supplemental terms, policies, or guidelines posted on the platform, and any agreements you enter into through the platform, constitute the entire agreement between you and KrewUp regarding your use of the platform. These Terms supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings, representations, and warranties, whether written or oral, regarding the subject matter hereof.

Amendments by KrewUp: KrewUp reserves the right to modify, update, or amend these Terms at any time in its sole discretion. If we make material changes to these Terms, we will notify you by: (i) posting the updated Terms on the platform with a revised "Effective Date"; (ii) sending an email to the address associated with your account; or (iii) displaying a prominent notice on the platform. Your continued use of the platform after the effective date of any amendments constitutes your acceptance of the amended Terms. If you do not agree to the amended Terms, you must discontinue use of the platform and terminate your account.

Review of Changes: We encourage you to review these Terms periodically to stay informed of any updates. The "Effective Date" at the top of these Terms indicates when the most recent revisions were made. Material changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no earlier than fourteen (14) days after posting, except for changes addressing new functions of the platform or changes made for legal reasons, which may be effective immediately.

No Oral Modifications: These Terms may not be modified or amended by any oral statement, course of dealing, or conduct of any party. No amendment shall be binding unless it is in writing and either: (i) posted on the platform by KrewUp as described above; or (ii) signed by an authorised representative of KrewUp.

Waiver: No failure or delay by KrewUp in exercising any right, power, or remedy under these Terms shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power, or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power, or remedy. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by an authorised representative of KrewUp to be effective.

Assignment: You may not assign, transfer, or delegate your rights or obligations under these Terms without KrewUp's prior written consent. KrewUp may freely assign, transfer, or delegate its rights and obligations under these Terms without restriction and without notice to you, including in connection with any merger, acquisition, reorganisation, or sale of assets.

Third-Party Beneficiaries: These Terms do not create any third-party beneficiary rights in any person or entity, except that KrewUp's officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, and affiliates are intended third-party beneficiaries of the indemnification, limitation of liability, and dispute resolution provisions herein.

Headings: The section headings in these Terms are for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation of any provision.
