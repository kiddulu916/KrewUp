# Stripe Subscription Flow Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide covers testing the CrewUp Pro subscription system from local development through production deployment.

## Prerequisites

### Required Stripe Setup

Before full testing is possible, you need:

1. **Stripe Account**
   - Sign up at https://stripe.com
   - Use Test Mode for development
   - Switch to Live Mode for production

2. **Create Products in Stripe Dashboard**

   Navigate to Products → Add Product:

   **Monthly Plan:**
   - Name: "CrewUp Pro Monthly"
   - Price: $15.00 USD
   - Billing period: Monthly
   - Copy the Price ID (starts with `price_`)

   **Annual Plan:**
   - Name: "CrewUp Pro Annual"
   - Price: $150.00 USD
   - Billing period: Yearly
   - Copy the Price ID (starts with `price_`)

3. **Environment Variables**

   Add to `.env.local`:
   ```env
   # Stripe Keys (from Stripe Dashboard → Developers → API Keys)
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...

   # Price IDs (from Products you created above)
   STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PRO_MONTHLY=price_...
   STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PRO_ANNUAL=price_...

   # Webhook Secret (set up in step 4 below)
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
   ```

4. **Webhook Configuration**

   **Local Development (Stripe CLI):**
   ```bash
   # Install Stripe CLI
   brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

   # Login to Stripe
   stripe login

   # Forward webhooks to local server
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe

   # Copy the webhook signing secret (whsec_...) to .env.local
   ```

   **Production:**
   - In Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks
   - Add endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
   - Select events:
     - `checkout.session.completed`
     - `customer.subscription.updated`
     - `customer.subscription.deleted`
     - `invoice.payment_failed`
   - Copy webhook signing secret to production environment variables

- [ ] Live mode API keys in production environment
- [ ] Production products created with correct pricing
- [ ] Production webhook endpoint configured
- [ ] Webhook endpoint HTTPS only (required by Stripe)
- [ ] Test full checkout flow in production
- [ ] Monitor webhook delivery success rate
- [ ] Set up error alerting for failed webhooks
- [ ] Test subscription cancellation in production
- [ ] Verify email notifications are sent (Stripe automatic emails)
- [ ] GDPR compliance: Add data export for user subscriptions
- [ ] Terms of Service and Refund Policy links added to checkout

## Stripe Test Cards

**Successful Payment:**
- `4242 4242 4242 4242` - Visa

**Payment Failures:**
- `4000 0000 0000 9995` - Declined (insufficient funds)
- `4000 0000 0000 0341` - Declined (requires authentication)

**3D Secure:**
- `4000 0025 0000 3155` - Requires 3D Secure authentication

Use any future expiry date, any 3-digit CVC, any billing ZIP code.

## Monitoring and Logging

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- Successful checkout rate
- Webhook delivery success rate
- Failed payment rate
- Subscription churn rate
- Average subscription lifetime

**Log Analysis:**
- Search for "Checkout session error" → checkout failures
- Search for "Webhook handler error" → processing failures
- Search for "Database error" → data consistency issues

**Stripe Dashboard:**
- Events → Monitor all webhook deliveries
- Subscriptions → Track active/canceled counts
- Payments → Monitor successful/failed payments

---

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue: Webhook not receiving events locally**
- Solution: Ensure Stripe CLI is running (`stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe`)
- Verify webhook secret in `.env.local` matches CLI output

**Issue: "No subscription found" after checkout**
- Solution: Check webhook logs - ensure `checkout.session.completed` fired
- Verify webhook can write to Supabase (check admin client credentials)

**Issue: User shows as free tier despite active subscription**
- Solution: Check `useIsPro()` logic - requires both `status === 'active'` AND non-empty `stripe_subscription_id`
- Verify database has correct subscription row

**Issue: TypeScript errors about missing fields**
- Solution: Ensure `types/subscription.ts` matches database schema exactly
- Check that webhook handlers use correct field names

---

## Next Steps After Testing

Once all tests pass:

1. **Phase 3: Pro Features** - Implement the actual Pro features being gated
2. **Analytics** - Track conversion rates, churn, revenue
3. **Email Notifications** - Custom emails for subscription events
4. **Customer Support** - Tools to manage subscriptions for users
5. **Dunning** - Automated retry logic for failed payments (Stripe has built-in)
6. **Coupons/Trials** - Add promotional pricing options
