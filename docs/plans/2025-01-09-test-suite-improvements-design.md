# Test Suite Improvements Design

**Created:** 2025-01-09
**Status:** Approved
**Goal:** Comprehensive test coverage with testable architecture

---

## Overview

This plan addresses four key areas:
1. Extract pure business logic from Server Actions into testable services
2. Expand unit test coverage (co-located with source files)
3. Expand E2E test coverage (centralized in `e2e/`)
4. Implement gradual coverage enforcement with ratcheting thresholds

### Architecture Change

**Before:** All logic embedded in Server Actions (untestable)
```
Server Action = Context + Validation + Business Logic + Database
```

**After:** Pure logic extracted into services (testable)
```
Service = Validation + Business Logic (unit tested)
Server Action = Context + Service calls + Database (E2E tested)
```

### Test Organization

- **Unit tests:** Co-located next to source files (`feature/services/foo.test.ts`)
- **E2E tests:** Centralized in `e2e/` directory
- **Deprecated tests:** Remove `__tests__/integration/` and `__tests__/api/`

### Coverage Targets

| Category | Target | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Services/Utils | 80-90% | Pure functions, high value, easy to test |
| Hooks | 60% | State management, moderate complexity |
| Components | 50% | Focus on interactions, not snapshots |
| Server Actions | N/A | Tested via E2E happy paths |
