## Overview

KrewUp Pro subscription provides role-specific features to both workers and employers. The subscription is **$15/month or $150/year** with a single subscription status but different features based on user role.

### Design Principles

1. **Role-Based Value**: Workers and employers get different features but pay the same price
2. **Clear Differentiation**: Free tier provides core functionality, Pro adds premium capabilities
3. **Feature Parity**: Each role gets exactly 4 exclusive Pro features
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Pro features enhance (not replace) the free experience

## Worker Pro Features

### 1. Profile Boost ⭐

**Value Proposition**: Get noticed first by employers

**How It Works**:
- Pro workers' profiles automatically appear at the top of:
  - Job application lists viewed by employers
  - Candidate search results
  - Application notifications
- Visual "⭐ Boosted Profile" badge displayed on all profile cards
- Automatic 7-day boost periods renewed monthly for active Pro subscribers
- Countdown timer shows boost expiration: "Boost expires in 5 days"

**User Experience**:
```
Free Worker:  Listed by application date (newest first)
Pro Worker:   Always appears above free workers, then sorted by date
```

**Implementation Details**:
- Database fields: `profiles.is_profile_boosted` (boolean), `profiles.boost_expires_at` (timestamp)
- Webhook sets boost on subscription activation:
  ```sql
  UPDATE profiles
  SET is_profile_boosted = true,
      boost_expires_at = NOW() + INTERVAL '7 days'
  WHERE id = user_id
  ```
- All applicant queries modified to sort by boost first:
  ```sql
  ORDER BY worker.is_profile_boosted DESC, created_at DESC
  ```
- Background job (daily cron) resets expired boosts

**Complexity**: Low (1 day)
**Value**: High - immediate visibility boost

---

### 2. Proximity Alerts 📍

**Value Proposition**: Never miss nearby job opportunities

**How It Works**:
- Configure custom alert settings:
  - Radius: 5-50 km from current location
  - Trades to monitor: Select one or multiple trades
  - Active/inactive toggle
- Background job runs every 10 minutes checking for new jobs
- Notifications created when matching jobs are posted within radius
- In-app notifications + optional push notifications
- Email digest option (daily summary of nearby jobs)

**User Experience**:
```
1. Worker enables proximity alerts (25 km, Electrician trade)
2. New electrician job posted 20 km away
3. Within 10 minutes, worker receives notification:
   "New Electrician job nearby: Residential Wiring - 20.3 km away"
4. Click notification → Navigate directly to job posting
```

**Implementation Details**:
- Settings stored in `proximity_alerts` table
- Background worker (Vercel Cron) runs every 10 minutes:
  ```typescript
  // Find new jobs in last 10 minutes within user's radius
  SELECT * FROM jobs
  WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '10 minutes'
  AND trade = ANY(user_alert_trades)
  AND ST_DWithin(
    coords::geography,
    user_coords::geography,
    radius_km * 1000
  )
  ```
- Creates notifications in `notifications` table
- Notification bell shows unread count
- Push notifications via web Push API (optional)

**Complexity**: Medium-High (3-4 days)
**Value**: Very High - real-time job discovery

### 3. Who Viewed My Profile 👀

**Value Proposition**: Know which employers are interested in you

**How It Works**:
- System tracks all profile views automatically (for all users)
- Pro workers can see:
  - Full list of employers who viewed their profile
  - Employer name, company type (Contractor/Recruiter), view timestamp
  - Weekly summary: "12 employers viewed your profile this week"
  - Click to view employer's profile and send message
- Free workers see teaser: "5 employers viewed your profile - Upgrade to see who"

**User Experience**:
```
Pro Worker Profile View:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Who Viewed Your Profile             │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 12 employers this week              │
│                                     │
│ ⚡ John's Electric (Contractor)     │

│ 📋 ProStaff Recruiting (Recruiter)  │
│    Viewed 3 days ago     [Message]  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Implementation Details**:
- Track views in `profile_views` table:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO profile_views (viewed_profile_id, viewer_id)
  VALUES (profile_id, current_user_id)
  ```
- Query for Pro workers:
  ```sql
  SELECT viewer:profiles(name, employer_type), viewed_at
  FROM profile_views
  WHERE viewed_profile_id = current_user_id
  ORDER BY viewed_at DESC
  ```
- Gate display with `FeatureGate` component
- Show weekly count for engagement

**Complexity**: Low (1-2 days)
**Value**: High - engagement driver, FOMO effect

### 4. Verified Work History with Employer Endorsements ✅

**Value Proposition**: Build trust and credibility with third-party verification

**How It Works**:
- Workers request endorsements from previous employers listed in work history
- Employer receives email with one-click endorsement link
- Employer can verify work dates and optionally write 200-character recommendation
- Verified experiences show green checkmark icon
- Profile displays "Endorsed by 5 employers" badge
- Endorsements include:
  - Employer name and company
  - Verification of dates worked
  - Optional recommendation text
  - Timestamp of endorsement

**User Experience**:
```
Worker Flow:
1. Navigate to Profile → Experience
2. Click "Request Endorsement" on experience entry
3. Employer receives email: "John Doe requests work history endorsement"
4. Employer clicks "Review Request" → Redirects to endorsement page
5. Employer verifies details, writes recommendation, clicks "Approve"
6. Worker's experience now shows ✅ verified badge
7. Profile shows "Endorsed by 1 employer" badge

Employer View (on worker profile):
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ✅ Endorsed by 3 employers          │
│                                     │
│ Senior Electrician                  │
│ ABC Electric Co.                    │
│ Jan 2020 - Dec 2022 ✅ Verified     │
│                                     │
│ Endorsed by Mike Johnson            │
│ "Excellent worker, always on time.  │
│  Highly skilled in commercial       │
│  wiring. Would hire again."         │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Implementation Details**:
- New tables: `endorsement_requests`, `endorsements`
- New columns: `experiences.is_verified`, `experiences.endorsement_count`
- Request flow:
  1. Worker calls `requestEndorsement(experienceId)` server action
  2. Action checks Pro status, creates request in DB
  3. Sends email to employer with approval link
  4. Employer approves via `approveEndorsement(requestId, recommendationText)`
  5. Creates endorsement record, marks experience as verified
  6. Increments endorsement count via trigger
- Display EndorsementBadge on profile cards
- Show checkmark on verified experiences

**Complexity**: Medium (3-4 days)
**Value**: Very High - trust signal, competitive advantage

  BEGIN
    SELECT COALESCE(SUM(
      EXTRACT(YEAR FROM AGE(
        COALESCE(end_date, NOW()::DATE),
        start_date
      ))::INTEGER * 12 +
      EXTRACT(MONTH FROM AGE(
        COALESCE(end_date, NOW()::DATE),
        start_date
      ))::INTEGER
    ), 0)
    INTO total_months
    FROM experiences

## Feature Gating Architecture

### Three-Layer Enforcement System

**Layer 1: UI Components (UX Only)**

```typescript
// features/subscriptions/components/feature-gate.tsx
'use client'

import { useIsPro } from '../hooks/use-is-pro'
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'

interface FeatureGateProps {
  feature?: string
  children: React.ReactNode
  fallback?: React.ReactNode
  showUpgradePrompt?: boolean
}

export function FeatureGate({
  feature,
  children,
  fallback,
  showUpgradePrompt = true
}: FeatureGateProps) {
  const isPro = useIsPro()
  const router = useRouter()

  if (!isPro) {
    if (fallback) return <>{fallback}</>

    if (!showUpgradePrompt) return null

    return (
      <div className="p-6 text-center border-2 border-dashed rounded-lg bg-gray-50">
        <div className="inline-flex items-center justify-center w-12 h-12 mb-4 bg-blue-100 rounded-full">
          <span className="text-2xl">⭐</span>
        </div>
        <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Pro Feature</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Upgrade to KrewUp Pro to unlock {feature || 'this feature'}
        </p>
        <Button onClick={() => router.push('/pricing')}>
          Upgrade to Pro - $15/month
        </Button>
      </div>
    )
  }

  return <>{children}</>
}

// Usage Examples:

// Worker feature
<FeatureGate feature="proximity alerts">
  <ProximityAlertSettings />
</FeatureGate>

// Employer feature
<FeatureGate feature="experience-based search">
  <ExperienceFilterSlider />
</FeatureGate>

// Custom fallback
<FeatureGate
  feature="verified work history"
  fallback={<div>Upgrade to request endorsements</div>}
>
  <RequestEndorsementButton />
</FeatureGate>

// No prompt (silent hiding)
<FeatureGate feature="job analytics" showUpgradePrompt={false}>
  <AnalyticsChart />
</FeatureGate>
```

**Layer 2: Server Actions (Security)**

```typescript
// features/endorsements/actions/endorsement-actions.ts
'use server'

import { createServerClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server'

export async function requestEndorsement(experienceId: string) {
  const supabase = createServerClient()
  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()

**Layer 3: Database RLS Policies (Defense in Depth)**

```sql
-- Only Pro workers can insert endorsement requests
CREATE POLICY "Pro workers can request endorsements"
  ON endorsement_requests
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (
    worker_id = auth.uid() AND
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM profiles
      WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid()
      AND profiles.role = 'Worker'
      AND profiles.subscription_status = 'pro'
    )
  );

-- Only Pro employers can access analytics
CREATE POLICY "Pro employers can view job analytics"
  ON job_views
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM jobs
      WHERE jobs.id = job_views.job_id
      AND jobs.employer_id = auth.uid()
      AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM profiles
        WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid()
        AND profiles.role = 'Employer'
        AND profiles.subscription_status = 'pro'
      )
    )
  );

-- Only Pro workers can access proximity alerts
CREATE POLICY "Pro workers can manage proximity alerts"
  ON proximity_alerts
  FOR ALL
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    user_id = auth.uid() AND
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM profiles
      WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid()
      AND profiles.role = 'Worker'
      AND profiles.subscription_status = 'pro'
    )
  );
```

### Key Principle: Never Trust the Client

**CRITICAL**: Client-side gates are for UX only. Always enforce on server.

- ✅ API routes verify subscription status
- ✅ Server actions check Pro before executing
- ✅ RLS policies protect at database level
- ✅ Stripe webhooks are source of truth for subscription state
- ❌ Never rely on client-side `isPro` check for security

## Database Schema Changes

### New Tables

#### `endorsement_requests`

```sql
CREATE TABLE endorsement_requests (

### Modified Tables

#### `experiences`

```sql

## Email Service Integration

### Recommended Provider: Resend

**Why Resend**:
- ✅ Free tier: 3,000 emails/month
- ✅ Excellent Next.js integration
- ✅ React email templates
- ✅ Good deliverability
- ✅ Simple API

**Alternative**: SendGrid (more complex, better for high volume)

### Setup

#### 1. Installation

```bash
npm install resend @react-email/components
```

#### 2. Environment Variables

```env
# .env.local
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxx
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@krewup.net
```

#### 3. Email Client

```typescript
// lib/email/client.ts
import { Resend } from 'resend'

const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY!)

export interface EmailParams {
  to: string
  subject: string
  body: string
  html?: string
}

export async function sendEmail({ to, subject, body, html }: EmailParams) {
  try {
    const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({
      from: process.env.RESEND_FROM_EMAIL!,
      to,
      subject,
      text: body,
      html: html || body.replace(/\n/g, '<br>')
    })

    if (error) {
      console.error('Email send error:', error)
      return { error: error.message }
    }

    return { data }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Email send exception:', error)
    return { error: 'Failed to send email' }
  }
}
```

### Email Templates

#### Endorsement Request Email

```typescript
// lib/email/templates/endorsement-request.tsx
import { Html, Head, Body, Container, Text, Button } from '@react-email/components'

interface EndorsementRequestEmailProps {
  workerName: string
  position: string
  companyName: string
  startDate: string
  endDate: string | null
  approveUrl: string
}

export function EndorsementRequestEmail({
  workerName,
  position,
  companyName,
  startDate,
  endDate,
  approveUrl
}: EndorsementRequestEmailProps) {
  return (
    <Html>
      <Head />
      <Body style={{ fontFamily: 'sans-serif', backgroundColor: '#f6f9fc' }}>
        <Container style={{ maxWidth: '600px', margin: '0 auto', backgroundColor: '#ffffff', padding: '20px' }}>
          <Text style={{ fontSize: '24px', fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#1a202c' }}>
            Work History Endorsement Request
          </Text>

          <Text style={{ fontSize: '16px', color: '#4a5568', lineHeight: '1.6' }}>
            Hi there,
          </Text>

          <Text style={{ fontSize: '16px', color: '#4a5568', lineHeight: '1.6' }}>
            <strong>{workerName}</strong> is requesting that you verify their work experience at your company.
          </Text>

          <div style={{ backgroundColor: '#f7fafc', padding: '16px', borderRadius: '8px', margin: '20px 0' }}>
            <Text style={{ margin: '8px 0', color: '#2d3748' }}>
              <strong>Position:</strong> {position}
            </Text>
            <Text style={{ margin: '8px 0', color: '#2d3748' }}>
              <strong>Company:</strong> {companyName}
            </Text>
            <Text style={{ margin: '8px 0', color: '#2d3748' }}>
              <strong>Dates:</strong> {startDate} - {endDate || 'Present'}
            </Text>
          </div>

          <Text style={{ fontSize: '16px', color: '#4a5568', lineHeight: '1.6' }}>
            By endorsing this work history, you'll help {workerName} build credibility with future employers.
            You can also optionally leave a short recommendation.
          </Text>

          <Button
            href={approveUrl}
            style={{
              backgroundColor: '#3182ce',
              color: '#ffffff',
              padding: '12px 24px',
              borderRadius: '6px',
              textDecoration: 'none',
              display: 'inline-block',
              fontWeight: 'bold',
              margin: '20px 0'
            }}
          >
            Review Endorsement Request
          </Button>

          <Text style={{ fontSize: '14px', color: '#718096' }}>
            If you don't recognize this worker, you can safely ignore this email.
          </Text>
        </Container>
      </Body>
    </Html>
  )
}
```

#### Usage in Server Action

```typescript
// features/endorsements/actions/endorsement-actions.ts
import { sendEmail } from '@/lib/email/client'
import { render } from '@react-email/render'
import { EndorsementRequestEmail } from '@/lib/email/templates/endorsement-request'

export async function requestEndorsement(experienceId: string) {
  // ... validation and request creation ...

  const approveUrl = `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/dashboard/endorsements/${request.id}`

  const html = render(
    EndorsementRequestEmail({
      workerName: profile.name,
      position: experience.position,
      companyName: experience.company_name,
      startDate: formatDate(experience.start_date),
      endDate: experience.end_date ? formatDate(experience.end_date) : null,
      approveUrl
    })
  )

  const emailResult = await sendEmail({
    to: experience.employer.email,
    subject: `${profile.name} requests work history endorsement`,
    body: `${profile.name} is requesting endorsement. Click: ${approveUrl}`,
    html
  })

  // Don't fail request if email fails
  if (emailResult.error) {
    console.error('Email failed:', emailResult.error)
  }

  return { data: request }
}
```

### Email Best Practices

1. **Never block on email delivery**
   - Send asynchronously
   - Log failures, don't fail the action
   - Consider retry queue for important emails

2. **Rate limiting**
   - Max 10 endorsement requests per worker per day
   - Track in `endorsement_requests` table

3. **Testing**
   - Use Resend test mode in development
   - Send to your email first
   - Check spam folder

4. **Unsubscribe**
   - Add unsubscribe link to promotional emails
   - Store preferences in `profiles.email_preferences`
